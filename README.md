### **PROJECT DEATHDEALER**
![Example Image](githubImages/TitleImage.png)

## Description

The idea of Project Deathdealer (placeholder name), is to create yet another vampire survivor like game with a few new quirks to it. There is a game that inspired me called Median XL, a diablo II mod that creates difficult static boss content for solo players. These drop specific character altering attributes (I.E changing ability functionalities) and other unique things like custom loot tables. Generally vampire survivor like games only have wave like content and possibly a boss after a set milestone (generally time). The Idea for Project DeathDealer is to have a open world vampire survivor like game and when you are strong enough you can choose to go into these unique biome areas and challange the bosses essentially making this genre a hybrid.
## Features

- Unique mob types and wave sequences.
